# Project Name: Responsive Webpage for an Online Store.

In this project, I created a responsive website for an online (tech) store. I used HTML to structure the content and include some semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and
footer. Media queries were employed to facilitate responsive design, while a framework like Bootstrap was used to enhance the overall design/styling. 


##Design Choices & Development Process
Below are some key design decisions employed for this project:

###Design Philosophy

-Modern Gradient Theme: Used a purple-blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) for visual appeal and brand consistency
-Clean Typography: Implemented Segoe UI font family for excellent readability across devices
-Card-Based Layout: Product cards with subtle shadows and hover effects for better user interaction

###Responsive Design Strategy

-Mobile-First Approach: Used Bootstrap's grid system with custom breakpoints
-Flexible Layouts: Products stack vertically on mobile, display in rows on larger screens
-Adaptive Navigation: Collapsible hamburger menu for mobile devices
-Scalable Typography: Font sizes adjust automatically for different screen sizes
